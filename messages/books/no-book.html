<h1>Error 403</h1>

<p>Maybe you have just a wrong url. Go to http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/ first to see if the error persists.</p>

<p>If you get the error again check that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don't use anonymizers, open proxies, VPNs, or TOR to access Project Gutenberg. This includes the Google proxies that are used by Chrome.</li>
  <li>Don't access Project Gutenberg from hosted servers.</li>
  <li>Don't use automated software to download lots of books. We have a limit on how fast you can go while using this site. If you surpass this limit you get blocked for 24h.</li>
  <li>We have a daily limit on how many books you can download. If you exceeded this limit you get blocked for 24h.</li>
  <li>If you use the RSS feed, set your update interval to 24 hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you are sure that none of the above applies to you, 
and wish us to investigate the problem,
we need to know your IP address.
Go to <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/">this site</a>,
don't sign up, 
just copy the IP address 
(it looks like: 12.34.56.78 but your numbers will be different)
and
<a href="mailto:webmaster@gutenberg.org?subject=403%20help">mail it to us</a>.
If that page also shows a proxy address, we need that one too.
